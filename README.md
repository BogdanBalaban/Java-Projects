# 🧰 Java Projects Collection

Welcome to my personal repository that contains a collection of all the projects I have developed using **Java**. This repository is designed to serve as a central hub for exercises, personal experiments, and learning-focused applications.

Each folder in this repository represents an independent project, covering a variety of topics and functionalities—from basic algorithms and console applications to more advanced object-oriented programming and file-handling examples.

Whether you're here to explore Java code, looking for inspiration, or simply want to practice your skills, feel free to browse through the projects. Suggestions and contributions are always welcome!
